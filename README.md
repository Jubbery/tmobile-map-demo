# T-Mobile Demo - Map Visualization with React, Redux, D3, and WebGL

This project is a demonstration of my skills in creating advanced data visualizations using React, Redux, D3.js, Canvas 2D, and WebGL.

It showcases different approaches to map rendering and heatmaps, which are relevant to the work currently being done at T-Mobile.

The app is designed to highlight my ability to work with complex visualization technologies and is intended to serve as a discussion point during my upcoming interview with T-Mobile.

## Project Purpose

The `tmobile-demo` app was built to demonstrate my proficiency in the following areas:

- **React & Redux**: Managing state and UI logic efficiently in a modern frontend framework.
- **D3.js**: Creating dynamic and interactive maps using data-driven documents.
- **Canvas 2D**: Utilizing the HTML5 Canvas API for rendering 2D graphics and maps.
- **WebGL**: Developing high-performance heatmaps with Three.js, leveraging the power of WebGL for complex visual computations.
- **Quantum Maps**: Implementing visualization techniques that align with T-Mobile's focus on Quantum Maps and WebGL heatmaps.

This application is designed to be a strong candidate for demonstrating my technical capabilities in map visualizations and frontend development, making it an ideal project to present to T-Mobile interviewers.

## Usage

To run this, you will need a [Mapbox token](http://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/docs/get-started/mapbox-tokens). You can either set it as `MAPBOX_TOKEN` in `map.js`, or set a `MapboxAccessToken` environment variable in the command line.

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

To build a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```
